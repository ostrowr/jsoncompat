# Codex instructions

- Don't take any shortcuts; this is production-ready code
- Use the most constrained types possible
- You're running in a sandbox; you'll need to set the TMPDIR environment variable to something like $(pwd)/tmp
- See `readme.md` for the desired behavior of this library
- Ensure the code is as idiomatic as possible
