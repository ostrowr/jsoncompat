## General guidelines

- Don't take any shortcuts; this is production-ready code
- Use the most constrained types possible
- See `readme.md` for the desired behavior of this library
- Ensure the code is as idiomatic as possible

## Tests

`bootstrap.sh` has already been run for you. Run `just check` to run a full test suite.

All of the typical cargo commands are available; see also .github/workflows/ci.yml for what we're checking
in CI. Ensure that any changes you make are covered by tests and documentation.
